Feature: Determining whether a specified NodeJS version has reached End-Of-Life (EOL)
  
  Scenario Outline: Checking various dates for a known version
    When I see if "<version>" is EOL on "<date>"
    Then the result will be that it is <eolOrNot>
    
    Examples:
      | version | date       | eolOrNot |
      | v12     | 2022-04-29 | not EOL  |
      | v12     | 2022-05-01 | EOL      |

  Scenario: Checking an unknown version
    When I see if "v9876" is EOL on "2021-03-22"
    Then the result will be that we do not know whether it is EOL
