Feature: Extracting Docker base image details from a Dockerfile
  
  Scenario: Simple FROM line
    Given a Dockerfile with the following contents:
      """
      FROM owner/image
      RUN something
      """
    When I get the base images from that Dockerfile
    Then the result will be the following:
      """
      owner/image
      """
  
  Scenario: Multistage Dockerfile
    Given a Dockerfile with the following contents:
      """
      FROM owner/builder AS builder
      COPY something
      FROM owner/base
      RUN something-else
      """
    When I get the base images from that Dockerfile
    Then the result will be the following:
      """
      owner/builder
      owner/base
      """
